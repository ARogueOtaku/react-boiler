# **React Boiler Custom**

React Boiler Custom is a Nodejs utility Package which helps create a Minimal React Application using Webpack and Babel.

## **Usage**

There are 2 ways you can use this package:

1. The package can be installed using the following command: `npm install --save-dev react-boiler-custom`. Post install you can just use `react-boiler-custom [appname] [authorname]` to create your React App.
2. Or you can simply use `npx react-boiler-custom [appname] [authorname]` to create a React App without installing the package.

Post App Creation follow these steps:

1. Change the Current Directory to the newly created App by `cd <appname>`.
2. Run `npm install` and wait for all necessary modules to be downloaded.
3. Run `npm start` to start a Development Server or Run `npm run build` to Build the App for Production.
